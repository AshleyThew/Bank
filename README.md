   BANK:
     CONVERTER_BANKCRAFT_ENABLED: true
     CONVERTER_CHESTBANK_ENABLED: true
     CONVERTER_ECONOMYBANK_ENABLED: true
   ```
5. Restart the server

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Plugin not loading:**
- Ensure you're running Spigot/Paper 1.13+
- Check that Java 8+ is installed
- Verify the core plugin was downloaded correctly

**Database connection errors:**
- Check MySQL/MongoDB credentials in config files
- Ensure database server is running and accessible
- Verify firewall settings allow connections

**Permission issues:**
- Check your permissions plugin configuration
- Verify player has required permissions
- Use `/bank admin debug` for permission testing

**Data not saving:**
- Check auto-save settings in config
- Verify database connection is stable
- Check server logs for save errors

### Performance Optimization

**For large servers:**
- Use MySQL instead of SQLite
- Increase auto-save timer
- Enable specific save triggers only when needed
- Configure appropriate interest timer intervals

**Memory optimization:**
- Set reasonable transaction history limits
- Use slot limits to prevent excessive item storage
- Configure tab limits based on server capacity
